## Repository Contents

- **STL Files**: Ready-to-print 3D models for all 3D-printed components
- **STEP Files**: For manufacturing and modification
- **Sample Assemblies**: We provide sample assembly files to help you get started
  - [Autodesk Fusion](https://a360.co/4kUyEb5)
  - [SolidWorks](https://github.com/enactic/openarm_hardware/tree/main/SolidWorks)
> **Contribute assemblies** for other CAD platforms via pull request! We'd love to expand our library! If you create assemblies in OnShape, Inventor, or any other CAD software, please share them with the community. Your contributions help makers worldwide get up and running faster.

## Contributing

We encourage the open-source community to contribute assembly files for other CAD software platforms! Create assembly files for your preferred CAD software (SolidWorks, OnShape, FreeCAD, etc.)

Also, feel free to contribute different customizations for your project ideas!
Submit a pull request with your files organized in the appropriate folder structure.
